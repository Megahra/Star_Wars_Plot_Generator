The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to :planetA:. While the Congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two agents, :personA: and :personB:, to settle the conflict...\",\r\n\t\"There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. This separatist movement, under the leadership of the mysterious :personA:, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. Senator :personB:, is returning to the Galactic Senate on :planetA: to vote on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist the overwhelmed Jedi...\",\r\n\t\"War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless :personA:. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere. In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, :personB:, has swept into the Republic capital on :planetA: and kidnapped the leader of the Galactic Senate. As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Galactic Senate leader...\",\r\n\t\"It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base on :planetA:, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by :personA:, a sinister agent of the Empire, :personB: races home aboard the Millennium Falcon, custodian of the stolen plans that can save the people and restore freedom to the galaxy...\",\r\n\t\"It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy. Evading the dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by :personA: has established a new secret base on :planetA:. The evil :personB:, obsessed with finding :personA:, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space...\",\r\n\t\":personA: has returned to his home planet of :planetA: in an attempt to rescue his friend :personB: from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does :personA: know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...\",\r\n\t\":personA: has vanished. In the meantime, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until the last Jedi has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General :personB: is sent on a mission to find :personA: and to finally restore peace and justice to the galaxy. :personB: has sent the REPUBLIC's most daring pilot on a secret mission to :planetA:, where an old ally has discovered a clue to :personA:'s whereabouts...\"\r\n]","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport logo from \"./logo.svg\";\r\nimport \"./Generator.css\";\r\nimport plots from \"./plots\";\r\n\r\nlet swapiPeople = {\r\n  0: [\"Luke Skywalker\", \"male\"],\r\n  1: [\"R2-D2\", \"n/a\"]\r\n}; //is an object of arrays containing name and gender properties\r\nlet swapiPlanets = [\"Tattoine\", \"Hoth\"]; //is an array of name properties\r\n\r\n//function Generator() {\r\nclass Generator extends Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n  \tplotText: replacePlaceholders(plots[0])\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  onClickButton = () => {\r\n\tthis.setState({\r\n\t\tplotText: generatePlot(plots)\r\n\t})\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"Generator\">\r\n        <button onClick={this.onClickButton}>Generate Plot</button>\r\n        <p>{this.state.plotText}</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n//ToDo: Get SWAPI data and put it into the global variables swapiPeople and swapiPlanets\r\nfunction fetchPlaceholders() {\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction generatePlot(plots) {\r\n  let plot = randomizePlot(plots);\r\n  return replacePlaceholders(plot);\r\n}\r\n\r\n//Optional: Replace pronouns depending on gender (would need to insert pronoun-placeholders into texts first)\r\nfunction replacePlaceholders(plot) {\r\n  //ToDo: fetchPlaceholders()\r\n  let personA = randomizeElement(\"person\");\r\n  let personB = randomizeElement(\"person\");\r\n  while (personA === personB) {\r\n    personB = randomizeElement(\"person\");\r\n  }\r\n  let planetA = randomizeElement(\"planet\");\r\n\r\n  return plot\r\n    .replace(/:personA:/g, personA)\r\n    .replace(/:personB:/g, personB)\r\n    .replace(/:planetA:/g, planetA);\r\n}\r\n\r\n//Returns the name property of the element\r\nfunction randomizeElement(type) {\r\n  if (type === \"person\") {\r\n    let swapiPeopleKeys = Object.keys(swapiPeople);\r\n    let randomPeopleKey = swapiPeopleKeys[randomIntFromInterval(0, swapiPeopleKeys.length - 1)];\r\n    return swapiPeople[randomPeopleKey][0];\r\n\r\n  } else if (type === \"planet\") {\r\n    let randomPlanet = swapiPlanets[randomIntFromInterval(0, swapiPlanets.length - 1)];\r\n    return randomPlanet;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction randomizePlot(plots) {\r\n  return plots[randomIntFromInterval(0, plots.length - 1)];\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction randomIntFromInterval(min, max) {\r\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Generator;","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
